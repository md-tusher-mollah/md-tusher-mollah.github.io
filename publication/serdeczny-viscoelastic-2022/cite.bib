 abstract = {This paper presents a novel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model that simulates the nonisothermal ﬂow of a viscoelastic ﬂuid through the hot-end in ﬁlament-based Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEX). The hot-end is an essential part of the printhead, as it melts and extrudes the polymeric material. Thus, robust modelling tools are necessary for optimising its operation. In this study, a viscoelastic CFD model is used to predict the ﬁlament feeding force and the results are validated against the experimental measurements at diﬀerent ﬁlament feeding rates, liqueﬁer temperatures, nozzle diameters and liqueﬁer lengths. It is found that the viscoelastic model is more accurate than the commonly used Generalised Newtonian Fluid approximation and it captures the inﬂuence of process conditions on the feeding force. Finally, the model is used to optimise the hot-end channel. Among others, it is shown that the feeding force can be minimised by selecting an optimal liqueﬁer diameter.},
