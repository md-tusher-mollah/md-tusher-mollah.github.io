 abstract = {This study presents the numerical solution of velocity and temperature fields based on mass conservation, momentum and energy balances for the time-dependent Couette-Poiseuille flow of Bingham materials through channels. The channel flow of Bingham fluid concerns the flow of cement paste in the building industry and the mudflow in the drilling industry. The specific aim is to introduce the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena specified by both Ion-slip and Hall currents into the non-isothermal channel flow in a theoretical approach. The Bingham constitutive equation is formulated by the generalized Newtonian fluid technique and solved by employing the explicit Finite Difference Method (FDM) using the MATLAB R2015a and Compaq Visual FORTRAN 6.6a both. For the exactness of numerical performance estimations, the criteria for stabilization and the convergence factor are analyzed. The velocity and temperature profiles are discussed individually at the moving and stationary walls of the channel. It is observed that magnetohydrodynamic phenomena accelerate the flow, and the temperature distributions reach the steady-state situation earlier than velocity distributions. Furthermore, the dominance of MHD parameters on the velocity distributions, shear stress, temperature distributions, and Nusselt number are discussed.},
