 abstract = {Digital light processing (DLP) as a vat photopolymerization technique is one of the most popular three-dimensional (3D) printing methods, where chains are formed between liquid photocurable resin molecules to crosslink them and solidify the liquid resin using ultraviolet light. The DLP technique is inherently complex and the part accuracy depends on the process parameters that have to be chosen based on the fluid (resin) properties. In the present work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are presented for top-down DLP as photocuring 3D printing. The effects of ﬂuid viscosity, travelling speed of build part, travelling speed ratio (ratio of the up-to-down traveling speeds of build part), printed layer thickness, and travel distance considering 13 various cases are scrutinized by the developed model to obtain a stability time of ﬂuid interface. The stability time describes the time it takes for the ﬂuid interface to show minimum ﬂuctuations. According to the simulations, a higher viscosity leads to prints with higher stability time. However, lower stability times in the printed layers are caused by a higher traveling speed ratio (TSR). The variation in settling times with TSR is extremely small in comparison to that of viscosity and travelling speed variations. As a result, a declining trend can be detected for the stability time by increasing the printed layer thickness, while by enhancing the travel distance values, the stability time demonstrated a descending pattern. In total, it was revealed that it is essential to choose optimal process parameters for achieving practical results. Moreover, the numerical model can assist in the optimizing the process parameters.},
