 abstract = {The primary intention of this practice is to numerically investigate the extracellular fluid (ECF) flow for unsteady 2dimenstional case along with a porous vertical plate with the appearance of a transverse magnetic field in a rotating system. The dimensional basic equations have been non-dimensionalized by necessary dimensionless variables. The EFDM has been practiced to solve the dimensionless equations. The numerical data have been evaluated by FORTRAN software version 6.6a. For a perfect conductivity, Magnetic Diffusivity Number values have been taken between 5 to 15 in the induction formula. For proper exactness, stability and convergence tests have been performed. For initial time   1, the outputs have been illustrated for the primary, secondary and angular velocity, primary and secondary induced magnetic field, temperature field with shear stresses for x and z -direction, couple stress for z -direction, x and z direction current densities and Nusselt number. Finally, the outcomes of different parameters are discussed separately and pictorial graphically by MATLAB R2018a.The findings of this research may be used to control cell temperature, measurement of extracellular fluid motion, and so on.},
