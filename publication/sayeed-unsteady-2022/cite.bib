 abstract = {A conceptual boundary level experiment of heat and mass transfer ﬂow in an MHD viscous nanoﬂuid containing gyrotactic microorganisms around a stretching cylinder has been evaluated in this work. The governing equations of the ﬂow have been executed by the boundary layer phenomena. The primary non-linear PDEs have been turned into a dimensionless form via application of suitable dimensionless variables. The resulting non-similar dimensionless diﬀerential equations have been resolved by the EFDM with the help of FORTRAN software version 6.6a. Stability and convergence criteria analysis enabled obtaining the convergent solutions. The consequences of numerous parameters such as the Magnetic parameter, Brownian motion parameter, Thermophoresis parameter, Lewis number, Micro-organism Lewis number, and Bio-convection parameter on the ﬂow have been investigated, and the outcomes have been demonstrated graphically. Finally, the current outcomes were compared with the previously published results.},
