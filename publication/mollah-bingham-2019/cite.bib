 abstract = {The numerical approach has been performed to study the Bingham fluid flow through an oscillatory porous plate with Ion-Slip and Hall current. Initially, at time; t  0 both the fluid and the upper plate are at rest. At time; t  0 the upper plate begins to oscillate in its own plane while the lower plate is stationary. The lower plate temperature is constant while the upper plate temperature has oscillated. A uniform magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plates. To obtain the dimensionless equations from the governing non-linear partial differential equations, the usual transformations have been used. The explicit finite difference technique has been applied to solve the obtained dimensionless equations. The MATLAB R2015a has been used for numerical simulation. For the accuracy of the numerical technique, the stability and convergence criteria have been discussed and the system has found to be converged for Pr  0.08, i  2, Ha  20, k0  8 k  2 and Re  0.011 with e  0.10 , Ec  0.10 , Y  0.05 and   0.0001 . The steady-state solution has achieved at the dimensionless time   2.00 . At the steady-state time, the effect of several parameters on the flow patterns, local shear stress and the Nusselt number have been shown graphically.},
