 abstract = {The fluid flow along the Riga plate with the influence of magnetic force in a rotating system has been investigated numerically. The governing equations have been derived from Navier-Stokesâ€™ equations. Applying the boundary layer approximation, the appropriate boundary layer equations have been obtained. By using a usual transformation, the obtained governing equations have been transformed into a coupled dimensionless non-linear partial differential equation. The obtained dimensionless equations have been solved numerically by an explicit finite difference scheme. The simulated results have been obtained by using MATLAB R2015a. Also, the stability and convergence criteria have been analyzed. The effect of several parameters on the primary velocity, secondary velocity, temperature distributions as well as the local shear stress and the Nusselt number have been shown graphically.},
