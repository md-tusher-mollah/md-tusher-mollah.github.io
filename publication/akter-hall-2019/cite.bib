 abstract = {The Hall effects on Casson fluid flow along a vertical plate has been investigated numerically. The governing equations have been derived from Navier-Stokesâ€™ equation and boundary layer approximation has been employed. By using usual transformations, the obtained non-linear coupled partial differential equations have been transformed into dimensionless governing equations. These equations have been solved by applying the explicit finite difference method. The MATLAB R2015a tool has been used for numerical simulation. The stability and convergence criteria have been analyzed. The effect of some important parameters on the primary velocity, secondary velocity, temperature and concentration distributions as well as local shear stress, Nusselt number and Sherwood number have been shown graphically.},
