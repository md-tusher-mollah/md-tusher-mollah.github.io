A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is developed to predict the deposition flow of viscoplastic ma­ terials such as ceramic pastes, thermosets, and concrete. The viscoplastic materials are modelled with the Bingham rheological equations and implemented with a generalized Newtonian fluid model. The developed CFD model applies a scalar approach to differentiate the rheology of two layers in order to capture the deposition of a wet layer onto a semi solidified printed layer (i.e., wet-on-semisolid printing). The semi solidification is modelled by a yield stress buildup. The cross-sectional shapes of the deposited layers are predicted, and the relative deformation of the first layer is studied for different yield stress buildups and processing conditions such as printing- and extrusion-speed, layer height, and nozzle diameter. The results of the CFD model illustrate that the relative deformation of the first layer decreases non-linearly with an increase in yield stress, and that stable prints can be obtained when taking into account the semi solidification. Furthermore, it is found that the deformation is dependent on a non-trivial interplay between the extrusion pressure, the shape of the cross-section, and the contact area between the layers. Finally, the results highlight which process conditions can be changed with benefit in order to limit the requirement on the yield stress buildup and still provide stable prints.","tags":[],"title":"Computational analysis of yield stress buildup and stability of deposited layers in material extrusion additive manufacturing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hesam Moghadasi","Md Tusher Mollah","Deepak Marla","Hamid Saffari","Jon Spangenberg"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688323769,"objectID":"ba83e3baa426f2892183f781778c3b4a","permalink":"https://md-tusher-mollah.github.io/publication/moghadasi-computational-2023/","publishdate":"2023-07-02T18:49:27.647178Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moghadasi-computational-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital light processing (DLP) as a vat photopolymerization technique is one of the most popular three-dimensional (3D) printing methods, where chains are formed between liquid photocurable resin molecules to crosslink them and solidify the liquid resin using ultraviolet light. The DLP technique is inherently complex and the part accuracy depends on the process parameters that have to be chosen based on the fluid (resin) properties. In the present work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are presented for top-down DLP as photocuring 3D printing. The effects of ﬂuid viscosity, travelling speed of build part, travelling speed ratio (ratio of the up-to-down traveling speeds of build part), printed layer thickness, and travel distance considering 13 various cases are scrutinized by the developed model to obtain a stability time of ﬂuid interface. The stability time describes the time it takes for the ﬂuid interface to show minimum ﬂuctuations. According to the simulations, a higher viscosity leads to prints with higher stability time. However, lower stability times in the printed layers are caused by a higher traveling speed ratio (TSR). The variation in settling times with TSR is extremely small in comparison to that of viscosity and travelling speed variations. As a result, a declining trend can be detected for the stability time by increasing the printed layer thickness, while by enhancing the travel distance values, the stability time demonstrated a descending pattern. In total, it was revealed that it is essential to choose optimal process parameters for achieving practical results. Moreover, the numerical model can assist in the optimizing the process parameters.","tags":[],"title":"Computational Fluid Dynamics Modeling of Top-Down Digital Light Processing Additive Manufacturing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md.

It is noticed that there occur two different types of rotations in a rotating curved duct such as positive and negative rotation. The positive rotation through the curved duct is widely investigated while the investigation on the negative rotation is rarely available. The paper investigates the influence of negative rotation for a wide range of Taylor number (−10 ≤ Tr ≤ −2500) when the duct itself rotates about the center of curvature. Due to the rotation, three types of forces including Coriolis, centrifugal, and buoyancy forces are generated. The study focuses and explains the combined effect of these forces on the fluid flow in details. First, the linear stability of the steady solution is performed. An unsteady solution is then obtained by time-evolution calculation and flow transition is determined by calculating phase space and power spectrum. When Tr is raised in the negative direction, the flow behavior shows different flow instabilities including steadystate, periodic, multi-periodic, and chaotic oscillations. Furthermore, the pattern variations of axial and secondary flow velocity and isotherms are obtained, and it is found that there is a strong interaction between the flow velocities and the isotherms. Then temperature gradients are calculated which show that the fluid mixing and the acts of secondary flow have a strong influence on heat transfer in the fluid. Diagrams of unsteady flow and vortex structure are further sketched and precisely elucidate the curvature effects on unsteady fluid flow. Finally, a comparison between the numerical and experimental data is discussed which demonstrates that both data coincide with each other.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of Rotation on Transient Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer Through a Curved Square Duct: The Case of Negative Rotation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md.

The channel flow of Bingham fluid concerns the flow of cement paste in the building industry and the mudflow in the drilling industry. The specific aim is to introduce the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena specified by both Ion-slip and Hall currents into the non-isothermal channel flow in a theoretical approach. The Bingham constitutive equation is formulated by the generalized Newtonian fluid technique and solved by employing the explicit Finite Difference Method (FDM) using the MATLAB R2015a and Compaq Visual FORTRAN 6.6a both. For the exactness of numerical performance estimations, the criteria for stabilization and the convergence factor are analyzed. The velocity and temperature profiles are discussed individually at the moving and stationary walls of the channel. It is observed that magnetohydrodynamic phenomena accelerate the flow, and the temperature distributions reach the steady-state situation earlier than velocity distributions. Furthermore, the dominance of MHD parameters on the velocity distributions, shear stress, temperature distributions, and Nusselt number are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Non-isothermal Bingham fluid flow between two horizontal parallel plates with Ion-slip and Hall currents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md.

Two CFD models are investigated: a previously-published one-phase model, where the entire domain is filled with liquid, and a novel model, where the free surface of the polymer inside the channel is resolved. Both models predict a recirculation region between the nozzle wall and the incoming filament. With the free surface resolved, melting of the solid filament and filling of an empty liquefier channel are shown in detail. Moreover, the simulations predict the pressure and temperature distributions inside the channel. The molten polymer (ABS) is simulated as a Generalized Newtonian Fluid with shear- and temperature-dependent viscosity. The numerical results are compared with the experimental measurements of the filament feeding force, which relates to the pressure inside the flow channel. An inverse analysis of the heat transfer coefficient is performed to estimate the thermal resistance at the channel’s wall. It is shown that the model which resolves the free surface is able to predict the feeding force for typical working conditions with a reasonable accuracy. Moreover, it captures the change of the flow regime from stable to unstable extrusion at high feeding rates. A hypothesis that explains the pressure and melt zone oscillations that occur during unstable extrusion is given. The influence of the liquefier temperature, liquefier length and nozzle diameter on the flow are discussed. The predictions of the model become less accurate when different channel geometries are simulated, which is attributed to the simplified material model that does not capture viscoelastic effects and possible buckling of the solid filament.","tags":[],"title":"Numerical modeling of the polymer flow through the hot-end in filament-based material extrusion additive manufacturing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sheela Khatun","Md.

The obtained dimensionless equations are solved numerically using the explicit finite difference method (FDM). The studio developer Fortran (SDF) 6.6a and MATLAB R2015a are both used for numerical simulations. The stability criteria have been established and the system is converged for Prandtl number 𝑃 ≥ 0.08 with Δ𝑌 = 0.05 and Δτ = 0.0001 as constants. As a key outcome, the steady-state solutions have been occurred for the dimensionless time τ = 4.00.
